This project implements a file compression tool that efficiently compresses large files or groups of files using multi-threading. The main goal is to reduce file sizes for storage optimization or faster transfer while maintaining high performance by leveraging multiple threads for parallel processing.

Key Features:

Multi-threading Support: The compression process is split into multiple threads to enable parallel execution. This significantly speeds up the compression process by utilizing multiple CPU cores.

File Compression Algorithm: The tool uses well-known compression algorithms (e.g., ZIP, GZIP, or custom algorithms) to compress files. The algorithm ensures that the compression ratio is maximized without sacrificing quality.
